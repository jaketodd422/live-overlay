This overlay is just for live (git,svn,cvs,hg,darcs,et cetera) ebuilds. It was
inspired by my want for the bleeding-edge versions of the free software I use
the most.

All of the ebuilds here have an active upstream and are not going to be patched.
There's no reason to patch a piece of software that has an active upstream, as
it is constantly changing.

Ebuilds use EAPI 2. Use src_configure for econf, if use blah, et cetera. Add
*highly* experimental software to profiles/package.mask. When pushing commits,
update and commit the README, then update and commit the updated ebuild and
manifest. Test your ebuilds before submitting them.
