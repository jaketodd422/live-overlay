This overlay is just for live (git,svn,cvs,hg,darcs,et cetera) ebuilds. It was
inspired by my want for the bleeding-edge versions of the free software I use
the most.

All of the ebuilds here have an active upstream and are most likely not going to
be patched, mostly because it's a pain.

Ebuilds use EAPI 2. Use src_configure for econf, et cetera (read the gentoo dev
handbooks). Add *highly* experimental software to profiles/package.mask. 

When pushing commits, update and commit the README, then update and commit the
updated ebuild and manifest. Remember test your ebuilds before submitting them.
