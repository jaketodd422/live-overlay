This overlay is just for live (git,svn,cvs,hg,darcs,et cetera) ebuilds. It was
inspired by my want for the bleeding-edge versions of the free software I use
the most.

All of the ebuilds here have an active upstream and are not going to be patched.
There's no reason to patch a piece of software that has an active upstream, as
it is constantly changing.

Ebuilds use EAPI 2.
